This is a basic next project that shows a leaflet map on a next/react page. What we've done:
- npx create-next-app@latest
- removed the google font (because next template is garbage?)
- navigate to application folder and install components: npm i leaflet react-leaflet
- create 'components/map' folder
- within that folder create index.js and map.js
- map.js needs to import MapContainer and TileLayer and then put those components on the page
- index.js needs to import map component as turn off server side rendering
- on page.js add the Map component AND put "use client" at top (necessary??)
- style the map so that it has a with and height
- npm run dev



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
